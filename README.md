## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet) on Lovable. If you want to deploy your project under your own domain then we recommend using Netlify or GitHub Pages with a custom domain. Visit our docs for more details: [Custom domains](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain/)

For GitHub Pages with a custom domain:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section
4. Under "Custom domain", enter your domain name
5. Update your domain's DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages
